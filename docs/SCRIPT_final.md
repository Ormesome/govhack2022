# Script - Alternate

Welcome to the govhack 2022 entry for team Data Florist.

The Australian Taxation Office has a superb tool called the Business Performance Check found within the ATO mobile application.

Using this tool Business Owners can compare stats like their operating costs against an aggregate of other similar businesses to find out if they could do better.

But I wonder...

Besides the already present financial aspect, how else can we compare businesses?

What does the modern consumer look for in a business?

And can we use such a tool to promote environmental awareness - to preserve and sustain our environment?


Let's start by incorporating social media, by aggregating customer scores

and by aggregating employee scores.

We have moved the measurement from financial performance to management performance.


We can do more.

Let's ask our businesses to compare their resource consumption.

Let's ask coffee shops to compare their water usage.

Let's ask hair dressers to compare their electricity usage.

Let's ask fish and chip shops to compare their gas usage.

Let's ask kindergartens to compare their wastewater production.

Let's ask mechanics to compare their air quality.


This sort of reporting allows businesses to compare their resource efficiencies, but there is a risk that it breeds complacency. Why improve if you're already "good enough"?

We can give businesses a push in two ways.

First, we allow local and state governments the ability to offer incentives for achieving stretch goals.

Second, and probably of more impact, we expose this same information in a slightly different format to consumers.

All consumers shop for value and for quality, but once you've narrowed down your options you start to shop with your heart instead of your wallet. You shop for value alignment.

And today, we're shopping for the environment.

This sort of social pressure encourages businesses to chase the 5 star rating. To buy more efficient equipment. Which in turn puts market pressure on suppliers and manufacturers.


By expanding the reach of the ATO Business Performance Check we are able to empower businesses to become more efficient, and in the process to use consumer choice to help the environment through reduction of water use, wastewater production, electricity and gas use, air polution.
