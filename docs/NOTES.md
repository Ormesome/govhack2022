# General Notes

This project uses a blend of data from the ATO, Open Data Portal, and other sources both real and proposed to create a tool for business owners and consumers to make better decisions for the environment and their bank account.

## What makes a winner

"What do we look for in a winning project?

Originality and feasibility. Try to propose something useful that hasn’t been thought of before.

A good mix of technical data use, business analysis, communication and presentation.

Use of data on the Queensland Government Open Data Portal – data.qld.gov.au.  Feel free to mix and match with external data sources!" -- 

## What is a small business

Small businesses are defined by the ABS by the number of employees:

| Employees | Number of businesses | % of total |
| --------- | -------------------: | ---------: |
| 0 to 19 (small) | 2,314,647 | 97.4 |
| 20 to 199 (medium) | 56,835 | 2.4 |
| 200+ (large) | 4,271 | 0.2 |
| Total | 2,375,753 | 100 |

The ATO and ASIC defines a small business by the gross turnover.

## Where is water used

In the United States, in 2015, 6.9% of water usage was residential and 3.5% was commercial. By far the largest consumer of water was power generation (thermoelectric) at 41.4% followed by irrigation at 36.7%.

Similar data for Australia is hard to acquire.

## Why didn't I use ABS data

I considered entering the _The 2021 Australian Census (National)_ challenge offered by the ABS. It was fairly open ended, only requiring that I use a single dataset, but I couldn't find a dataset that worked well with small businesses.

### Wages

There's no benefit to showing a business of 2 people that their wages are above average, nor of informing their customers. If their prices remain competative then their slim profit margins are their own concern.

### Diversity

Small businesses, having less than 20 employees, make up 97% of businesses and will naturally score poorly on any diversity ranking. A single data point variation (like employing your son/daughter) will have huge ramifications in the aggregate due to the small sets being measured.
