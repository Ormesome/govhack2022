Welcome to the govhack 2022 entry for team Data Florist.

  [fade to white]

The Australian Taxation Office has a superb tool called the Business Performance Check found within the ATO mobile application.

  [fade in screen shot of the app]

But the question must be asked - besides the already present financial aspect, how else do business owners want to compare themselves?

In this world of social networks the obvious answer is social media.

So let's inject some customer reviews

  [app scrolls upwards to reveal the customer rating]
  [social media logos appear with arrows pointing at the phone]

but it's not enough just to ask what do customers think. Perhaps we should find out what the employees are saying.

  [app scrolls upwards to reveal the employee rating]
  [social media logos appear with arrows pointing at the phone]

That cuts a little close, doesn't it?

What's this? The Queensland government wants businesses to be more environmentally pro-active?

Let's add some comparative metrics for water usage

  [app scrolls upwards to reveal the water usage rating]
  [unity water logo appears with arrows pointing at the phone]

And some comparative metrics for air quality

  [app scrolls upwards to reveal the air quality rating]
  [BOM logo appears with arrows pointing at the phone]

Surely the air quality here isn't as bad as the competitor 2 blocks down! Perhaps we can ask the Bureau of Meteorology to install an IoT device just outside this office?

I've got my house electricity hooked up to an IoT.

  [switch apps to the energy screenshot. Hold 2. switch back to the ATO app]

Let's pretend that the Australian Energy Market Operator has a commercial IoT that we have access to

  [AEMO logo appears with arrows pointing at the phone]

And gas

  [app scrolls upwards to reveal the gas usage rating]
  [AEMO logo appears with arrows pointing at the phone]

And now we can track how resource efficient and environmentally active a business is.

Oh. The state government reports all this plus sewerage for schools?

  [cross fade to spreadsheet for schools. Hold 2. cross fade back to the ATO app]

I guess that means we should, too.

  [app scrolls upwards to reveal the sewerage usage rating]

With all this, we now have a wide cross section of how a business performs versus the competition.

We can work to be just as profitable, while also reducing our impact on the environment.

If the government wanted too, they could offer rebates for achieving stretch goals, just like kickstarter.

  [logos and arrows fade to 50%]

  [the rating bar gets a stretch goal section indicating a goal of 2% improvement]

Finally, capitalism is driven by choice, and the modern consumer chooses based on alignment of their core values.

We need to expose all this to our consumers.

  [the measure bars are replaced by 5 star ratings]
  [app scrolls downwards so that we can see all the star ratings, and a search bar ar the top with "Data Florist" in the search bar]

  [punchy slide showing each bullet point as I say it]

This tool will empower
- businesses to improve
- consumers to choose
- governments to motivate

By making efficiency improvements and pollution reduction a competition we put preserving and sustaining our environment fair and square in our best interests.
