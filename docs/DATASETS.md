**Title** Business Performance Check

**Description** An example of the data used by the Business Performance Check tool within the ATOs mobile application.

**How it was used** The basis of the design. Used to compare erformance of similar businesses.

## Dataset 2

| Datasets |
| -------- |
| https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/digital-water-meter-dataset-explanation |

**Title** Unitywater - Digital Water Meter data

**Description** This data set contains extracts from a large number of Digital Water Meters located at residential homes and a few commercial properties , across the Sunshine Coast region. 

**How it was used** It is proposed that the dataset be expanded to include more (all) commercial properties, and enriched to allow correlation with an ATO provided identifier.

## Dataset 3

| Datasets |
| -------- |
| https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/air-quality-monitoring-2020 |

**Title** Air Quality Monitoring - 2020

**Description** Annual hourly air quality and meteorological data by monitoring site for the 2020 calendar year. For more information on air quality, including live air data, please visit [https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/pollution/monitoring/air](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/pollution/monitoring/air).

Data resolution: One-hour average values (one-hour sum for infall)  
Data row timestamp: Start of averaging period  
Missing data/not monitored: Blank cell  
Calm conditions: No hourly average wind direction is reported when the hourly average wind speed is zero  
Barometric pressure: Values are at monitoring station elevation, not corrected to mean sea level  
Daily zero/span response check: Automated instrument zero/span response checks are conducted daily between midnight and 1am at Queensland Government sites (can differ at industry sites). Where this takes place an ambient hourly value cannot be reported.  
Sampling height: Four metres above ground (unless otherwise indicated)

**How it was used** It is proposed that the site locations be correlated with the business addresses provided by the ATO to provide closest match air quality reporting. Further, the number of IOT devices should be expanded to allow greater granularity and coverage.


## Dataset 4

| Datasets |
| -------- |
| https://www.aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/about-the-national-electricity-market-nem |

**Title** Information page for AEMO

**Description** I'd like a breakdown of electricity and gas provided to each business address.

**How it was used** I'd like to correlate the electricity and gas provided to each address with the ATO business register to provide a report of each businesses electricity and gas usage.

## Dataset 5

| Datasets |
| -------- |
| https://qldwater.com.au/Sewerage |

**Title** Information page about sewerage, provided by QLD Water

**Description** Is it even possible to get a breakdown of wastewater production for an address?

**How it was used** I'd like to correlate the wastewater produced by each address with the ATO business register to provide a report of each businesses wastewater production.

## Dataset 6

| Datasets |
| -------- |
| https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/queensland-state-schools-utilities-expenditure |

**Title** Queensland state schoolsâ€”utilities expenditure

**Description** State school utilities expenditure such as electricity, sewerage, waste, garbage and water - excluding telecommunications.

**How it was used** This is an awesome spreadsheet and formed the basis of my project. What if we could do this for every business in Australia? What if we could tell each business whether they were using more or less than the average consumption for their business type and LGA? What if we could guilt businesses into better practices by sharing this data with consumers?
