## The Proposal

The Business Barometer is a web application and mobile application, an extension to the existing ATO Business Performance Check, that will wrangle and aggregate a range of data to allow business owners to see how their business compares to other similar businesses. The application will continue to use the low, medium, and high presentation format using actual metrics.

This data includes
- the existing Small Business Benchmarks
- Yelp reviews
- Glassdoor reviews
- air quality data from Open Data Portal
- water usage data from Open Data Portal
- electricity usage data, to be sourced from AEMO
- gas usage data, to be sourced from AEMO
- sewerage usage data, to be sourced from qldwater

The Business Barometer CE is a consumer edition of the application allowing individuals to look up a local business and see it's profile. Instead of using low/medium/high the application will use a 5 star rating that is based on the same data.

Consumers don't need to see all the detailed metrics that the business owner needs. The business owner will see the number of litres of water that they are using, but the consumer might see a 4 star rating. The consumer doesn't need to see a businesses profitability so their view of the the financials will be based on "am I getting a good deal".

It is anticipated that the environmentally conscious consumer will make decisions when buying goods and services based on a businesses alignment with their values.

It is also anticipated that businesses will take steps to become more efficient, not just to reduce expenses, but also to compete on a values basis for customers.

It is further anticipated that when businesses are more selective, their buying power in turn causes suppliers and manufacturers to produce more efficient products.

## The Challenges Addressed

### Small business performance indicators (National)

*Challenge:* How can we help small business owners to easily compare how their business is tracking across a range of performance indicators compared to other similar businesses?

*Eligibility*: Use at least one ATO data set.

### Digitising your drinking water (QLD)

*Challenge:* Clean water is an essential service for our communities and has been identified as the "Blue Gold" for the next generation. How might data be harnessed to influence people to reduce water consumption? How might monitoring and tracking water usage now help protect this valuable resource for future generations?

*Eligibility:* Open to everyone. Must use the Unitywater dataset. Must use at least one other dataset.

### Environment (QLD)

*Challenge:* What can we do to ensure the sustainability of Queenslandâ€™s natural environment?

*Eligibility:* Must use at least one dataset from data.qld.gov.au.
